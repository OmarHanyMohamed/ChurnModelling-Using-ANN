# ChurnModelling-Using-ANN
So in this notebook we will be dealing with Churn Modeling i.e. we will create an Artificial Neural Network to predict as to which customers will be leaving the bank.

# Problem Statement
It is no secret that customer retention is a top priority for many companies;acquiring new customers can be several times more expensive than retaining existing ones. Furthermore, gaining an understanding of the reasons customers churn and estimating the risk associated with individual customers are both powerful components of designing a data-driven retention strategy. A churn model can be the tool that brings these elements together and provides insights and outputs that drive decision making across an organization.So it is used to predict as to which customers will be leaving the bank.

# What is Churn Rate?
Churn rate (sometimes called attrition rate), in its broadest sense, is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period. It is one of two primary factors that determine the steady-state level of customers a business will support.

# Requirments
There are some general library requirements for the project, such as:
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn 
- Keras
